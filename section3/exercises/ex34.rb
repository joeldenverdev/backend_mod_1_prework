# Study Drills
# 1. January 1, 2010 is like a cardinal number and not an ordered number.
# 2. Below:
trees = ["Oak", "Maple", "Apple", "Aspen", "Pine"]
oak = trees[0]
maple = trees[1]
apple = trees[2]
aspen = trees[3]

puts "The trees in the Array are: #{oak}, #{maple}, #{apple}, #{aspen}, and #{trees[4]}."

# 3. Done (tested and works as expected).
