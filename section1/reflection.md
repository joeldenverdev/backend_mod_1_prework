## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- The list of traits of a super learner had a mix of things I don't do and some that I do.  I think that I have a growth mindset as I've always been interested in opportunities to continue learning despite already having a job.  I am also usually good about taking breaks, but the structure of my breaks could improve. I want to work on a mindset that learning is a process.  Too often I view learning as a means to a specific destination which I focus on far too often.  I think this is a great list, and often see lists like this which include waking up early, however I think that it can be possible to be very successful and focused as someone who might be a night owl.

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An integer is a whole number.  A float is a number which contains a decimal.  A math operation with integers will not produce decimals, even if they should on a calculator.  Floats will at least have ".0" if the float is still a whole number.

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
Interpolation is when a variable is added to a string, for example.
Ex: `puts "My nephew's favorite animal at the zoo is a #{animal}."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
`gets` -OR- `gets.chomp`

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
`.length` returns an integer that is the length of the variable or string.
`.split` returns an array and splits based on spaces, by default.
